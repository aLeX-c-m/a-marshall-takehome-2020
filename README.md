# a-marshall-takehome-2020

Using this design, create an interactive web page that uses the following technologies:

#Hugo static site builder

#Bootstrap 4

#Sass css pre-compiler (comes out of the box with Bootstrap 4, but you will have to figure out a way to build your own css

The source should be accessible in a source control management system: github, gitlab, bitbucket, etc.


Additional info/requirements:

#It's fine to have all the links resolve to an anchor (#). This should be a single page site

#The page should be responsive and look good at all resolutions

#Include some sensible functionality using Javascript (or at least show how you might organize logic)

#There will be some choices you need to make around the design; what happens when a user interacts with elements, how to arrange the page in mobile resolutions, etc. Be prepared to discuss your choices.

Bonus points:

#Use s3 and cloudfront to host the static website
