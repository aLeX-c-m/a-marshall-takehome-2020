#set up

clone the repo and run the following from the "datadog-trial" directory:
- npm install
- hugo server -D

# assignment

Using this design, create an interactive web page that uses the following technologies:

Hugo static site builder

Bootstrap 4

Sass css pre-compiler (comes out of the box with Bootstrap 4, but you will have to figure out a way to build your own css

The source should be accessible in a source control management system: github, gitlab, bitbucket, etc.


Additional info/requirements:

It's fine to have all the links resolve to an anchor (#). This should be a single page site

The page should be responsive and look good at all resolutions

Include some sensible functionality using Javascript (or at least show how you might organize logic)

There will be some choices you need to make around the design; what happens when a user interacts with elements, how to arrange the page in mobile resolutions, etc. Be prepared to discuss your choices.

Bonus points:

Use s3 and cloudfront to host the static website

# notes

items not included at submission/considerations for future improvement:

- a responive client list div where a brand square expands to a brand testimonial on hover and displaces other squares accordingly

- cohesive mobile response styling

-javascript on click tracking

-reorganization of file structure—hugo css compiling error necessitated unconventional reorganization of file structure
